# Blink Detection

This study supports the *blink* module in [Lai-YT/webcam-applications](https://github.com/Lai-YT/webcam-applications).

## Purpose

We want to detect whether the user blinks or not from the video.

## Implementation

### Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)

T. Soukupová and J. Čech found out that the eye aspect ratio, which is defined
as the ratio of the height to width of the eye, changes between opened and
closed eyes, and so we can detect the moment of blink by observing whether the
*EAR* drops below a specific *threshold* [1]. \
But a static *threshold* fails under different situations and a dynamic one is
hard to find. \
Instead of using fancy *SVM*, we generalize the blink detection problem to a
**change point problem**. When a blink is made, the *EAR* changes dramatically and
rapidly.

### Change Point Detection

The following GIF illustrates how a window-based change point detection works
with the standard deviation (*STD*) as its *cost function* [2].

The critical parameters are

1. `WINDOW_SIZE`: size of the window
1. `DRAMATIC_STD_CHANGE`: how dramatic the change in *STD* is to be considered
as a change point

These parameters control how sensitive the detection is. \
In this Implementation, we only observe the *STD* change between 2 successive
points, one may observe 3 or more of them, and define the occurrence of *dramatic std change* to be a blink (change point). \
The following picture shows the result of a 3 minutes blink detection with
`WINDOW_SIZE = 9` and `DRAMATIC_STD_CHANGE = 0.008`. \
Vertical lines are the blinks that are detected.

## How to start?

The detection works under the `main.py` file, 2 modes are provided:
1. video mode
2. live stream mode, which opens the webcam

```
python main.py [./$(video_path) | live]
```

### Video mode

By specifying a video file path, you use the video mode. You are suggested to put the video under `video/`. \
The whole video will be blink-detected, which takes approximately as long as the
video time and generates a *txt* file with the same name as your video file to the
`video/` folder, that is the *EAR*s of all the frames in the video.

### Live stream mode

By providing `live` as command line argument, you use the live stream mode. \
The webcam will be opened and captures frames of the user. Blink detection works
in real time and shows the current blink count onto the window. \
After closing the live stream with `q`, a *txt* named `ratio-%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` is generated next
to the main file, that is the *EAR*s of all the frames in the live stream.

### Plotting EARs and blinks

```
python plot_ratios.py ./$(file_path) [show]
```

The file arguments is the *txt* *EAR* file generated by `main.py`. If `show`
argument is provided, the plot shows directly without storing as an image file;
if not provided, the *png* file is stored to the `plots/` folder with the same
name as the *EAR* file.

### Plotting the real blinks

If you want to compare the real blinks with the detected blinks, you can use the
annotation file.

```
python annotate_blink.py $(video_to_annotate)
```

The frames of the video will be shown one by one. If a blink occurs, key in
`o`, otherwise `x`. *Notice that a single blink may take more than 1 frame, but
mark only one of them as `o`.* \
After the annotation, a *json* file named `ann-%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` is generated next
to the *annotate_blink.py*, this is because you may annotate a single video
several times. \
Choose the one you think best fits the real blinks, rename it with the same name
as the *EAR* file (keep the suffix *json*) and put it under `video/`. \
Then re-run `plot_ratios.py`, you'll see the real-blinks are plotted with red dots!
